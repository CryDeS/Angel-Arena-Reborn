Main PR Rules:
 - Balance PR can't be declined without explanations
 - Keep project code-style (just look at some project files and I think you will get it )
 - Don't make a mega-commit with large changes. Just create a several step-in-step commits.
 - If there is not exists subject of commit(i.e fixing a typo or another small change) you can use commit message with one dot( i.e "." )
 - Write commit messages for all important thing!
 - Use English for commit messages(even for localization).
 
Other things:
 - All configs must be 'combined' before using in game(that can be done with "File merger.exe")
